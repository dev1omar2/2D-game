# 2D-game

To start off I want to point out that the assets arent mine I took them from the chanel : RyiSnow

I  still havent completed everything, this is kind a demo to hte game

to compile and run the Game, just download everything and open the .sln file with VS, and just hit the "Local debugger" or whatever button and it should work, btw use the 2d Game-V2.sln file

The main entry point is at the Main/main.cpp file, from there we include the Game.h file, the Game.cpp file is where most of the work happens

have fun looking at the project! (you wont)
