# 2D-game

To start off I want to point out that the assets arent mine I took them from the chanel : RyiSnow

I  still havent completed everything, this is kind a demo to hte game

The main entry point is at the Main/main.cpp file, from there we include the Game.h file, the Game.cpp file is where most of the work happens

have fun looking at the project! (you wont)
